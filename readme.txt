This is a simple site. To get this to work, you must set up a local database
MySQL Workshop. In server/index.js, you can adjust the credentials as desired.

To run the program, you must set up two terminals,

cd/server
npm start

cd/client
npm start

This site will allow you to create a username and password, along with 
recognizing your creditionals. It also hashes your passwords.

Enjoy!
